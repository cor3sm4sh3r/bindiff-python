# bindiff-python
Binary diffing from python, super dirty - requires IDA and bindiff installed, you'll need to update the path constants if you aren't using version 6.9 and 4.2 respectively.

Cobbled together from a combo of: http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8495/can-i-invoke-idas-plugin-bindiff-from-command-line, https://syscall.eu/blog/2014/06/08/bindiff_export/ and some hacky changes to make either of them work.
